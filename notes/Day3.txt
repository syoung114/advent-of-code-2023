kernel shape 7x3:
.......
.......
.......

this because numbers are at most 3 long. if we find numbers relative to special character then the we slide kernel until special character is dead centre. numbers are either direction relative to that centre.

therefore start counting from 6. always subtract 6 for kernel start. subtract 3 for kernel middle. do this so that i < length is foolproof.

splitAtRange 0 6 "abcdefghijkl"
"abcdefg"

splitAtRange 1 7 "abcdefghijkl"
"bcdefgh"

im something of a convolutional neural network myself.
